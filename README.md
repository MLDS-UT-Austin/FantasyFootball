## Gamelog data
Currently we have gamelog data for players who were in the top 50 in passing yardage or field goal attempts in any given year or were top 100 in total scrimmage yards (receiving or rushing yards) in any given year, from 2015 to 2021. They can be found in the `player_gamelogs` directory. As of writing, this encompasses 536 different players' entire career gamelogs.

## Yearly Leaders 
Additionally, we have tables for the yearly leaders in passing yardage, field goal attempts, or total scrimmage yardage for each year from 2015 to 2021. This is a comprehensive list for any player who achieved at least one of any of the above counting stats.
